Dear Cloudspace,

   In this repository you will find my solution to the Cloudspace programming practical.
It takes a raw email .txt file and parses it for what I've found in the industry to be the most
commonly needed and cited data from incoming emails.
I tried to keep myself to a 60 minute max on the python verison, and a 90 minute max on the
ruby version I have made (in a different repository). 
If I were to take more time with this, I would of course:
- Create better handling of multipart emails and
- Consider handling the various other MIME types one might encounter in a more complex email, such as audio, images, or video.
Also, 
 -Creating a list or a menu to allow the user to decide what is most relevant, 
  I think, would also be paramount. It is easy for me to say what should be parsed for, but
  suppose the user wanted to count the number of times each letter is used in an email for 
  the sake of some strange cryptological reasons, or wanted some other data...

  I've always used coding as a tool to serve the purpose at hand. It is interesting to me
  to finally consider the code as a good or a service provided to someone else.
  I commented to clarify as much as possible, but I welcome the opportunity to 
  chat with you and answer any further questions you may have.

Best regards,
Joshua Bush
